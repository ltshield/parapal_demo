_ParaPal is an AI-powered teacher assistant currently in active development for potential commercial release._

## Overview

ParaPal began as a year-long research project exploring how AI could meaningfully support K–12 educators. Through dozens of client interviews and hands-on testing with local teachers, my team of four identified two major pain points:

1. **Teachers spend too much time grading and writing reports — especially essays aligned to Common Core standards.**  
2. **Existing classroom data is underutilized due to the time and expertise required to analyze it.**

We built ParaPal to address both.

## What ParaPal Does

ParaPal is a conversational AI platform that:

- **Automatically grades student essays against Common Core (and custom) standards**
- **Generates teacher-friendly feedback and progress reports**  
- **Provides data-driven insights via a built-in agentic analysis system**

## Evolution of the Product

Our first iteration focused on *agentic data analysis*: ParaPal could interpret natural-language questions, write and execute Python code against teacher datasets, and return insights conversationally. Educators loved the concept and enjoyed working with the tool, but through continued testing, one problem surfaced as *far more urgent*:

> **Teachers were spending hours grading essays and writing standards-based reports that AI could realistically automate.**

So we pivoted.

## Current Focus: EssayGrader

Our new core system, **GradingAgent**, allows teachers to:

1. Upload student writing samples  
2. Select Common Core (or custom) standards  
3. Walk away — ParaPal handles the rest

ParaPal returns:

- **Recommended scores per standard**
- **Narrative feedback for each student**
- **Auto-highlighted documents of student work showing *why* each score was assigned**

All results feed into a consolidated **Reports Page**, making parent-teacher conferences, progress tracking, and documentation dramatically easier and faster. See our demo below!

Teacher feedback has lead us to determine the potential commercial viability of a tool like this, and current work is being done to further streamline this process and integrate it into our educators' workflows.
